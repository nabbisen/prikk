//! RFC 121 §2.1: a closed stdout must exit `0` silently, not panic. Drives the compiled `prikk`
//! binary through a real OS pipe whose read end is closed before the child has written anything --
//! the same failure the handoff's own `prikk verify | head -3` reproduces via a shell, made
//! deterministic here instead of depending on how much a real reader happens to consume first.
//!
//! **Why closing immediately, rather than reading a prefix first (`head -3`'s own shape):** the
//! child process still has to be scheduled, exec, and run before it writes anything, while the
//! parent closing its own read-end handle is a single, essentially instantaneous syscall in an
//! already-running process. Reading a few bytes and then dropping would still work in practice
//! (it's what a real `| head -3` does), but would make the test's reliability depend on that race
//! rather than the much wider one this version relies on -- see `dc59_commit_benchmark.rs` and
//! others in this same `tests/` directory for the project's existing tolerance for process-timing
//! based integration tests; this one needs no `sleep` or retry because the margin is large by
//! construction, not by luck.
