//! RFC 108 increment 3d, review v1's condition (`.git-exclude/reviewed/per-active-repair-review-v1.md`):
//! `prikk doctor --repair-wal-tail` used to report success, print "truncated 0", and exit 0 while
//! leaving a repairable trailing partial WAL untouched whenever an active session's lock was busy --
//! the review's own probe measured exactly this. `repair_repository`'s `active_repairs` field
//! already carried the skip and its reason; nothing in `prikk-cli` read it. This file reproduces the
//! review's own scenario end-to-end through the real binary and asserts both halves of the fix: the
//! skip and its reason reach stdout, and the exit code goes non-zero.
