//! DC-67 ordinary-use conformance suite.
//!
//! Three consecutive increments (DC-65, DC-64's incremental step, DC-66's queue fold) each had their
//! decisive defect found by running an ordinary **sequence** — never by inspection, never by an
//! existing gate. All three were the same shape: a path that only misbehaves the *second or later*
//! time it runs against a given thing. This project's assurance is aimed hard at adversarial and
//! structural failure (DC-41) and covers that axis well; this suite is the orthogonal one — ordinary,
//! repeated, sequential use, run through the compiled binary exactly as a user would.
//!
//! **N = 3.** The RFC's own floor (`N >= 3`; two is the boundary DC-65's original defect was missed
//! at, so it proves nothing here). A larger N was considered and rejected: this file drives the
//! compiled binary through nine sequences, each spawning several child processes per generation
//! (`commit`, `seal`, and `trust maintainer add`); N = 3 keeps total suite runtime bounded while still
//! showing the "second-or-later" pattern repeats rather than being a fluke of exactly one repetition.
//!
//! **Sequence 1** ("edit the same text file across N generations") is satisfied by the pre-existing
//! `dc65_text_edit_baseline.rs` — the RFC's own §3 says "keep it," not duplicate it. This file
//! implements sequences 2 through 9 (numbered to match the RFC's §3 list); §3's own item 10 is not a
//! tenth sequence but the ending requirement every sequence here follows: delete the worktree and
//! rebuild it from sealed history, asserting byte-exact content.
//!
//! **Result (criteria 4, 5): the prediction holds — two findings, neither fixed here.**
//!
//! 1. **`checkout --patch-materialize` does not support replaying `ReplaceBinary` or `ChangePerm`**
//!    (sequences 2 and 5 hit this independently: `error: ... patch replay plan does not yet support
//!    ReplaceBinary` / `... ChangePerm`). Pre-existing and partially known —
//!    `patch_replay/decode.rs` already names exactly `CreateFile`, file-`DeleteNode`, and `EditText`
//!    as wired, and DC-65's own store-level binary test worked around the `ReplaceBinary` half by
//!    checking `update_seq` instead of rebuilt content — but this suite is the first place that gap
//!    is shown to block criterion-2-style verification for two of the RFC's ten *named ordinary*
//!    sequences, not an exotic or adversarial one. Not a "second-or-later" defect (it fails
//!    identically at generation 1), so it doesn't confirm the RFC's specific prediction by itself, but
//!    it is a real, reportable gap this suite surfaced. Both sequences verify via `verify` and the
//!    still-committed worktree instead, documented inline at each site.
//! 2. **prikk has no "checkout branch into the worktree" step for active editing** — only
//!    `--patch-materialize`, which is read-only and writes to a separate directory. An ordinary
//!    two-branch workflow (commit on one branch, switch, commit on the other) run from one physical
//!    worktree directory is not directly supported: a file created for branch A is picked up as a new,
//!    untracked create relative to branch B's own baseline too, unless the user manually removes it
//!    first. `sequence_06` documents and works around this inline. This is not a bug — nothing crashes
//!    or corrupts state — but it is a real capability gap an ordinary multi-branch user would hit
//!    immediately, discovered by trying the sequence rather than by inspection.
//!
//! Per the RFC's own framing (§2: "either outcome is a good one; only not looking is bad"), both are
//! reported here as their own findings, not fixed in this increment (criterion 4) — the fixes, if any
//! are warranted, belong to whichever future increment owns `checkout`'s replay coverage and the
//! multi-branch worktree workflow respectively.
//!
//! **What remains uncovered (criterion 7):** multi-way branch topologies (more than two branches
//! diverging and reconverging via merge — DC-13's merge windows are out of scope for this repository's
//! current increments); rollback-draft interleaved with ordinary commits; symlink authoring (out of
//! scope for the product generally, per `worktree_patch.rs`'s own doc comment); non-Linux platforms
//! (DC-37 restricts all repository mutation to Linux; this suite, like the rest of the test tree, only
//! ever runs there); concurrent/multi-process ordinary use (two `commit` invocations racing, not one
//! process queuing serially — DC-66's chain fold is proven single-process only); cache deletion
//! interleaved *within* a single generation rather than between them (sequence 9 deletes between
//! commits, not mid-`commit`); and content-level rebuild verification for `ReplaceBinary`/`ChangePerm`
//! sequences, blocked by finding 1 above until `checkout`'s replay coverage is extended. This list is
//! deliberately not empty.
